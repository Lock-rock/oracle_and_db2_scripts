1.Set environment variable ORACLE_SID.

2.Restore spfile (These can be skipped if you don't need to restore spfile or pfile from backup)

 RMAN> startup nomount
 RMAN> restore spfile from '<path to Control File auto backup>';
 RMAN> shutdown immedate
 RMAN> startup nomount
3.Restore controlfile and database

 RMAN> restore controlfile from '<path to Control File auto backup>';
 RMAN> shutdown immedate
 RMAN> startup mount
 RMAN> restore database;
 RMAN> recover database; -- shouldn't be needed because DB was shutdown gracefully before backup
 RMAN> alter database open resetlogs;

Customer had doubts about applying level 1 on top of previous level1

Explained you can keep on apply level 1 on top of previous level 1 so long as you are not applying the archive logs

Scenario

Assuming last incremental level 1 would be 6th and after that you plan to do a PITR till 7th Aug

1st Aug --> level 0
2nd Aug --> level 1
3rd Aug --> level 1

6th Aug --> level 1

7th Aug only archivelogs from 6th Aug till 7th Aug

On destination db (19c)

You first restore the controlfile and level 0 from Aug 1 (Assuming directory structure of 12c and 19c db are similar)

Once the level 0 is restored you can then copy the Level 1 of 2nd aug alone to destination db and the catalog them. Once done you can issue recover database

Repeat the restore of the level 1 backup and recovery till August 6th

Assuming you want to recovery till Aug 7th Now Copy the archivelogs from 6th Aug to 7th AUg to destination and do an recovery

Before opening database



Brief steps



Restore 12c db to 19c db

Explained

Step 1> On the restored server the compatiblle parameter should be same as the 12c db

Step 2> restore the controlfile

Step 3> Restore the Level 0 backup

Step 4> When new Level1 is taken on the Source db copy it over to the destination db

on Destination db (Repeat this step for all the level 1 copied>

Rman target /

Catalog backuppiece '<level 1 backuppiece name copied>' ;

Or

Catalog start with '<path of the backuppiece copied on destination>

Rman> recover database ;

<Once the 6th Aug level 1 is applied>


Copy the archivelog backups from 6th Aug till 7th Aug the time you plan to do Point in time recovery

Catalog start with <'path of the archiveogs backuppiece copied on destination>' ;

Rman> run { set until time.... ;
recover database ; }


Once done

<Note as explained on call if you have added a new datafile in the database then you would need to restore controlfile on such occasion else controlfile restore is required only in step 1>

Step 5 :-
==========

Since the db is on 19c and backup restored from 12c you need to do an alter database open resetlogs upgrade


First ensure redo logs point to new location on 19c

SQL>Select member from v$logfile ;

Alter database rename file '<Old path andname>' to '<new path and new>' ;

Once done for all member

re-run the above query to ensure the path has changed


Do an fake recovery

Go back to Rman prompt

Rman> Alter database open restelogs upgrade ;

Once db is opened (If cdb envirnoment also execute below)

Connect /as sysdba

alter pluggable database all open upgrade;


Once done

Execute Manual19c upgrade scripts. ==============> If you need help in what script to Run I need to open a SR with upgrade team
